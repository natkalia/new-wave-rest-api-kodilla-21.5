# Testimonials REST API server

Exercise with REST API endpoints built with Express as exercise during Kodilla webdeveloper bootcamp (Module 21.5).

## Features

* REST API standard
* testimonials database as array of objects in db.js (fake database) including id, author, text fields
* available endpoints for HTTP requests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE:
    - `GET` `/testimonials` - returns whole content of array (i.e. from fake db)
    - `GET` `/testimonials/:id` - returns one element from array, according to its id
    - `GET` `/testimonials/random` - returns random element from array 
    - `POST` `/testimonials` - adds new element to array, in body: author, text, id generated by uuid
    - `PUT` `/testimonials/:id` - edits existing testimonial (author and text field) based on its id
    - `DELETE` `/testimonials/:id` - delete chosen testimonial from array
* error links are catched by middleware and response with 404 message is sent to user

## Technologies / tools

* express.js
* cors
* uuid for random id generator 
* endpoints tested with Postman

## TODO's
- [ ] add validation: check if all data is provided and if no, respond with message with error (not necessarily json)
